Another  contribution to I will be contributing to Scroll is  the development of a decentralized identity solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to enhance
privacy and security for users interacting with Scroll-based applications. 
This decentralized identity solution could allow users to control their personal information and digital identities securely while still enabling seamless
authentication and authorization processes within the Scroll ecosystem. By prioritizing privacy and security, 
Scroll can empower users to maintain control over their data and identities, thereby fostering trust and confidence in the platform. 
Additionally, integrating this decentralized identity solution could open up new possibilities for innovative applications and use cases,
such as secure voting systems, identity verification for financial transactions, and secure access to sensitive information or services.
